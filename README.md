# ML-Mall_Customer_Hierarchical_Clustering

I have created Machine Learning Model With Hierarchical Clustering for Mall Customer Prediction.

In this I've used Pythonâ€™s Famous libraries like [Numpy](https://numpy.org/), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/), and [Sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/) for Analysis, Vizualization and Model Development.

I've used [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) for coding!

# About

**Clustering**

Clustering is the task of dividing the population or data points into a number of groups such that data points in the same groups are more similar to other data points in the same group than those in other groups. In simple words, the aim is to segregate groups with similar traits and assign them into clusters.

**Hierarchical Clustering**

Hierarchical clustering, also known as hierarchical cluster analysis, is an algorithm that groups similar objects into groups called clusters. The endpoint is a set of clusters, where each cluster is distinct from each other cluster, and the objects within each cluster are broadly similar to each other.

**About the dataset**

This input file contains the basic information (ID, age, gender, income, spending score) about the customers of a mall. Spending Score is something you assign to the customer based on your defined parameters like customer behavior and purchasing data.

# Cluster Analysis

* Green - Low Income, Low Spending
* Yellow - Low Income, High Spending
* Red - Medium Income, Medium Spending
* Purple - High Income, Low Spending
* Blue - High Income, High Spending
